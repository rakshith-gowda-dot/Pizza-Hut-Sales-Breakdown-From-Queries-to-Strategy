# Pizza Hut Sales Breakdown

In this data analytics project, I conducted an in-depth SQL-based analysis of Pizza Hut’s sales dataset to uncover key business insights and support data-driven decisions.

The goal was to explore how sales performance varies across different dimensions such as order volume, revenue, pizza types, size preferences, and time.

This project gave me the opportunity to work with real-world-like transactional data, write optimized SQL queries, extract actionable insights, and translate those findings into potential business strategies.

## Objective

To analyze Pizza Hut’s sales data using SQL and derive insights that could help optimize menu offerings, identify customer preferences, and improve sales performance.

The focus was on importing the dataset, cleaning and preparing it, running analytical queries, and interpreting results for business application.

## Tools Used

- *MySQL Workbench* – Data cleaning and analysis  
- *Excel* – Initial data exploration and formatting  
- *GitHub* – Project hosting and version control  
- *CSV Dataset* – Includes detailed order, pizza type, and pricing information

## Dataset Summary

The dataset contains detailed information for each order, including:

- Order Date & Time  
- Pizza Type (Classic, Supreme, Veggie, etc.)  
- Pizza Size (Small, Medium, Large, etc.)  
- Quantity Ordered  
- Unit Price  
- Total Order Value  

After importing to MySQL, the data was cleaned and standardized (e.g., ensuring date formats, removing duplicates, validating numerical fields).

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

As part of this project, I identified and calculated KPIs relevant to restaurant sales optimization:

| KPI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| *Top-Selling Pizzas* | Identified pizzas with the highest total sales volume |
| *Revenue Leaders* | Ranked pizzas generating the most revenue |
| *Peak Order Hours* | Found the busiest hours for customer orders |
| *Size Preferences* | Determined most popular pizza sizes by volume |
| *Daily & Monthly Trends* | Analyzed fluctuations in sales over time |
| *Average Order Value (AOV)* | Calculated average revenue per order |
| *Category Performance* | Compared performance of different pizza categories |

These metrics provided both operational and strategic insights for menu planning, promotions, and staffing.
